**How does EnviroVision solve this problem?**

Analyzes previous carbon emission data, providing insights into historical environmental impact.
By leveraging ML and predictive analytics, EnviroVision forecasts future emission trends, aiding Irvine Gasoline in setting achievable carbon neutrality goals.
Additionally, EnviroVision offers tools for evaluating the effectiveness of different emission reduction strategies and selecting optimal carbon offsetting options.

**Technologies used:**
-> streamlit was used to build the UI.
-> pandas and matplotlib were utilized to analyze historical data.
-> a sci-kit learn model used linear regression based based on historical data to make future predictions.
